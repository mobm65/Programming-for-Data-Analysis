An Investigation into numpy.random

NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it provides the user with large multidimensional arrays. An array is a collection of 
elements which can have one or more dimensions.  A 1D array is called a vector and a 2D array is called a matrix.  Numpy arrays
are called ndarrays, or N-dimensional arrays.  Numpy offers many tools to help manipulate the arrays.

The random module of numpy produces uniformly distributed numbers. These will be used to generate the probability of a certain outcome.  

The first section of my notebook provides a brief outline of the necessity and uses of the Numpy.random program.

In the second section I have explained the uses of the random data function and the permutation function. I have included some examples
of how these functions are used and plotted the results.

In the third section the distributions I have delved into are; the Normal Distribution, the Geometric Distribution, the Uniform Distribution and 
the Binomial Distribution.

In the fourth section I have explained the purpose of the seed is generating datasets which can be repeated.  This is useful for training and 
testing datasets.
