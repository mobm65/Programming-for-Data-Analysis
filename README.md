An Investigation into numpy.random

NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it provides the user with large multidimensional arrays. An array is a collection of 
elements which can have one or more dimensions.  A 1D array is called a vector and a 2D array is called a matrix.  Numpy arrays
are called ndarrays, or N-dimensional arrays.  Numpy offers many tools to help manipulate the arrays.

The random module of numpy produces uniformly distributed numbers. These will be used to generate the probability of a certain outcome.  
There are two types of uniform distributions:discrete and continuous.  An example of a discrete distribution is rolling a die, it can only return positive whole numbers as it is not possible
to roll a 3.4. 
In continuous distributions every data point has an equal chance of appearing.  For example every element between 0.1 and 0.4 is as likely to be returned as every other.  The normal distribution
is an example of a continuous distribution, this distribution measures how likely each element is to deviate from the mean.
